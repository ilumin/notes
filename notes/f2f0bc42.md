# Understand React.FC 

- it might confuse but `FC` type are not type of component, but it's a type of component's argument or `prop` in React world

you can use simple type in argument just like this 

```typescript
function Greeting({ name }: GreetingProps) {
  // implementation
}
```

but it will errors, when we need to use inherit prop or a regular prop such as `child`

```typescript
function Greeting({ name }: GreetingProps) {
  // implementation
}

const App = () => <>
  <Greeting name="Lumin">
    {/* The next line throws errors! */}
    <span>{"..."}</span>
  </Greeting>
</>
```

but the prevent this error, a simple FC type won't be enough, we must implement type like these 

```typescript
type WithChildren<T = {}> = 
  T & { children?: React.ReactNode };

type GreetingProps = WithChildren<{
  name: string
}>

const Greeting:FC<GreetingProps> = ({ name }) => {
  // implementation
}

const App = () => <>
  <Greeting name="Lumin">
    {/* The next line are cool! */}
    <span>{"..."}</span>
  </Greeting>
</>
```

`React.FC` might conflict with some Javascript pattern, for example `defaultProps`

```typescript  
export const Greeting:FC<GreetingProps> = ({ name }) => {
  // implementation
};

Greeting.defaultProps = {
  name: "World"
};

const App = () => <>
  {/* in Javascript, the next line will work, but Typescript with React.FC with throw an errors */}
  <Greeting />
</>
```

but I don't like this pattern of Javascript, because it doesn't make sense and hard to read. The alternative we can use these code.

```typescript
type WithChildren<T = {}> = 
  T & { children?: React.ReactNode };

type GreetingProps = WithChildren<{
  name?: string
}>

export const Greeting:FC<GreetingProps> = ({ name: 'World' }) => {
  // implementation
};

const App = () => <>
  {/* the next line are cool! */}
  <Greeting />
</>
```
