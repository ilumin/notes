# Elixir can do destructor assignment operator just like Node.js

or we can say Node.js can do it just like Elixir

```elixir
{:ok, %{product: product} = wallet} <- ProductWallets.fetch_wallet(product_wallet_id)
```

This code fetch wallet data and return `{:ok, wallet}`
but the developer just want only `product` in wallet
