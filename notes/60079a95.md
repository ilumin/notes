# Trading Strategies

## DEMA

- use [[Exponential Moving Average crossovers]]# to determine the current market trend
- check whether longEMA and shortEMA are threshold% remove from each other
- use by Goomboo in Bitcointalk forum [^2] [^3]
- note: คือปกติ moving average จะเกิดสัญญาณซื้อขายเมื่อกราฟมันตัดกัน แต่ตัวนี้คือดู % แทน

from example config

```
# EMA weight (α)
# the higher the weight, the more smooth (and delayed) the line
short = 10
long = 21

[thresholds]
down = -0.025
up = 0.025
```

- short = shortEMA that move closer to current market (include noise)
- long = longEMA that lag behind the market more but also more resistant to noise
- the down and up threshold tell how big difference in the line need to be for it to be considered a trend 

## MACD[^4]

- use multiple price average (EMAs) of difference periods
- logic inside
  - threshold: a signal will triggered as soon as the difference goes above or below a config threshold
  - persistance: instead of trading as soon as the difference is above or below the threshold, the strategies will wait for a few candles to see if the difference keep persisting

## PPO[^5]

- similar to MACD

## RSI[^6]
