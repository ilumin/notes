# Indirect Questions

We can ask a question **indirectly** by putting it into a sub clause beginning with a question word or with if/whether. This makes the question sound less abrupt, more tentative.

- We need to know **what the rules are**.
- Can I ask you **how much you're getting paid for the job?**
- Could you tell me **where Queen Street is**, please?
- I'm trying to find out **who owns this building**.
- Do you know **when the train gets in?**
- I was wondering **if/whether you could give me a lift.**

**NOTE** 
We need to know _what are the rules._ (Incorrect)

For question `word` + `to-infinitive`

_Could you tell me **how to get there?**_

**NOTE** 
If the main clause is a statement (We need to know), then there is no question mark.

so, _Could you tell me **how to get there?**_

the main clause are _"Could you tell me"_ then the sub clause _"how to get there?"_ should have **?**

## Vocab

- abrupt: rude, sudden
- tentative: not curtain or fixed
